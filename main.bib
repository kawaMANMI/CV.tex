abstract = {The dynamics of two gas bubbles placed side-by-side in liquid between parallel rigid plates is studied numerically using the multiphase volume of fluid (VOF) model in OpenFOAM. This model solves a single set of Navierâ€“Stokes equations for both the gas in the bubbles and the surrounding liquid. Being initially stationary, the bubbles first expand to their maximum volume due to the high gas pressure inside them and then collapse. Both phases are treated as viscous and immiscible without any phase change. The model is validated against available experimental data of a single bubble oscillation between parallel plates and a bubble-pair oscillation near a single rigid wall. Parametric studies are then performed, with the main variables being the initial sizes of the bubbles and their standoff distances from the rigid plates. The bubbles exhibit symmetric or asymmetric behavior depending on these two variables. Three distinct scenarios are identified in the symmetric case based on the relative influence of bubble-bubble and bubble-wall interactions. The jet strength and direction, bubble oscillation period, coalescence, and early asymmetric bubble collapse are characterized by initial distances and radii. This study provides valuable insights into intricate hydrodynamic interactions and behaviors of bubble pairs bounded by rigid surfaces.}
